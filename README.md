# Interview Test Repository

This repository contains two main directories: `mock-server` and `tests`. Please take some time to understand what each of these directories represents.

## Directory Structure

1. `mock-server` - This directory contains a JSON server that serves as a mock server for our test environment. It's designed to emulate a real-world server environment and provides API endpoints that you'll need to use for your test.

2. `tests` - This is where you will find all the test instructions. Depending on the role you are applying for or the tech stack you'll be working with, different tests are available. Each test is represented by a Markdown file with the tech stack name.

## How to Proceed

Let's say you're a React Native developer. In this case, you would need to locate the `REACT-NATIVE.md` file in the `tests` directory. Open this file and follow the instructions thoroughly to complete the test.

## Important Note

Please make sure you run the mock server during your test, as you will need it to interact with the API endpoints as part of the tasks. The instructions to run the server are available in the `mock-server` directory.

Good luck with your test! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
